Hello, I'm Prashant Kumar Jha, a B.Tech student pursuing Information Technology from Poornima College of Engineering, Jaipur. With a strong technical skill set in C, C++, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Git & Github, WordPress, SQL, and DBMS, I have gained expertise in website and WordPress development. My soft skills in team management, communication, Canva, problem-solving, and creativity have helped me in working effectively in teams and delivering results.

Currently, as the Founder of Optezy, a digital marketing agency, I lead the team toward creating innovative solutions for clients. Additionally, I also serve as a Google Cloud Facilitator, where I assist in providing training and guidance to individuals and organizations in cloud computing.

My career goals and aspirations are to start my own business venture, where I can utilize my technical and soft skills to create unique solutions and make a positive impact in the industry.
